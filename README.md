This is simple Android application for displaying current exchange rate between Indonesian Rupiah and other world currencies, based on the last update of daily data of Central Bank of Indonesia. I use JSoup library to extract relevant information from https://www.bi.go.id/en/statistik/informasi-kurs/transaksi-bi/Default.aspx.

The known limitations of this application is that only several of world currencies are recognized. Besides, any change made on the source website will result in unexpected performance of this application.
